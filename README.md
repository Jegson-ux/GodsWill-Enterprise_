**[Data Preparation]()**

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks;

 - Data loading and inspection
 
 - Cleaning and formatting
        
       - Functions: 
            "Text" function ( The "TEXT" function argument allows you to format dates specifying a format code in       the format_text argument, it display dates in a    manner that suits the user.)
   
               =TEXT([@Date],"YYYY") , =TEXT([@Date],"DDDD"), =TEXT([@Date],"MMMM")

            "IFS" function ( The IFS function in Excel evaluates multiple conditions and returns a value based on the first true condition. It simplifies complex nested IF statements by allowing you to specify conditions and their corresponding results in a single function.)

               =IFS([@[Customer_Age]]<25,"Youth",[@[Customer_Age]]<=34,"Young Adult",[@[Customer_Age]]<=64,"Adult",[@[Customer_Age]]>65,"Seniors")

**[Recommendation]()**

- To maximize revenue, it's important to focus on bolstering inventory and ramping up marketing activities specifically for our top-selling products such as Road Bikes 
  and Mountain Bikes.
- Given that 51% of our profits are generated by male customers, it would be beneficial to implement customized promotions and products specifically designed to better 
  connect with this demographic.
- Consider using the patterns in profitability throughout the year to strategize for seasonal sales and special offers, particularly during peak profit periods.
- Developing targeted marketing strategies for various age groups allows businesses to focus on the most profitable segments within each demographic.
